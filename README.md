# **Gamma vs. Hadron Illness Classification – Project Overview**

## **1. Project Objective**
The goal of this project is to classify **Gamma and Hadron illnesses** based on specific **medical features** extracted from patient data. By applying **machine learning techniques**, particularly **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, we aim to develop a model capable of accurately distinguishing between these two illness types.

This classification can aid **medical professionals** in **diagnosis** and **decision-making**, ensuring that patients receive the appropriate treatment based on their illness category.

## **2. Dataset Description**
The dataset consists of several **numerical medical and biological features** that serve as indicators for distinguishing between **Gamma** and **Hadron illnesses**.

### **Key Features:**
- **fLength** – A measurement related to illness progression.
- **fWidth** – A width-related characteristic of the illness.
- **fSize** – A measure of severity based on medical data.
- **fConc** – Concentration of a specific biomarker.
- **fAsym** – Asymmetry of a detected pattern in the illness.
- **fM3long, fM3trans** – Higher-order medical characteristics.
- **fAlpha** – An angular measurement associated with the illness.
- **fDist** – Distance from a reference medical point.
- **class** – The target variable:
  - **1** → Gamma illness.
  - **0** → Hadron illness.

## **3. Project Workflow**

### **3.1 Data Preprocessing**
Before training the model, the dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps to ensure quality and consistency.

#### **a. Handling Class Imbalance**
Medical datasets often exhibit **imbalanced class distributions**, meaning one illness type is more prevalent than the other. To address this, **Random OverSampling** is applied to increase the number of samples in the minority class, ensuring a more balanced dataset for training.

#### **b. Feature Scaling**
Since the dataset contains numerical features with varying ranges, **StandardScaler** is used to standardize all values. This step ensures that the model learns patterns effectively without being biased by large numerical values.

#### **c. Splitting the Dataset**
To train and evaluate the model, the dataset is divided into three subsets:
- **Training Set (60%)** – Used to train the model.
- **Validation Set (20%)** – Used for fine-tuning model parameters.
- **Test Set (20%)** – Used to evaluate final model performance.

### **3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Before training the model, **data analysis techniques** are used to better understand the dataset and distinguish patterns between Gamma and Hadron illnesses.

#### **Key EDA Steps:**
- **Feature Distribution Analysis** – Histograms are plotted to visualize the probability distributions of each feature for both illness types. This helps identify which features contribute most to classification.
- **Correlation Analysis** – Examining relationships between different features to identify the most relevant medical indicators for classification.

EDA provides valuable insights that guide **feature selection** and **model optimization**.

### **3.3 Model Selection and Training**
The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm** is chosen due to its **simplicity and effectiveness** in classification tasks. The model follows these steps:
1. **Storing Training Examples** – The model retains all training data points.
2. **Finding the k Nearest Neighbors** – When a new patient’s data is provided, the model identifies the **k** closest cases in the dataset.
3. **Classifying the New Case** – The illness type is determined based on the majority class among the **k** nearest neighbors.

Different values of **k** are tested to determine the optimal number of neighbors for classification.

### **3.4 Model Evaluation**
Once the model is trained, it is tested using **validation and test data**. Several performance metrics are used to assess its accuracy and reliability:

#### **Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Accuracy** – The model achieves an accuracy of **91%**, meaning it correctly classifies **91% of illness cases**.
- **Precision** – Measures how many predicted Gamma (or Hadron) illness cases were actually correct.
- **Recall** – Measures how many actual Gamma (or Hadron) illness cases were correctly identified.
- **F1-Score** – A balanced metric that considers both **precision and recall**, providing a more comprehensive evaluation.

These metrics help determine if the model is **suitable for real-world medical applications**.

## **4. Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the application of **machine learning** in the **medical field** for **illness classification**. By:
- **Preprocessing the data**,
- **Balancing the class distribution**,
- **Applying KNN classification**,

the model effectively differentiates between **Gamma and Hadron illnesses**, achieving an accuracy of **91%**.

### **Future Improvements:**
To enhance performance, future iterations of the project could explore **more advanced machine learning models**, such as:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Random Forests**
- **Neural Networks**

These models may offer **higher accuracy and reliability**, making the classification system even more effective for medical diagnosis.
